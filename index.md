<button type="button" onclick="alert('ooo the button worked')">Click Me!</button>


I come from an engineering background with inspiration toward the medical field, all caused by the beautiful book "When Breath Becomes Air" by Paul Kalanithi. I enjoy working with and designing the electrical and signals portion of medical devices, and aspire to work between doctors and engineers and make life better for both!

Classes! I'm currently taking Biomedical Instrumentation, Signals and Systems, Biological transport phenomena, and Augmented Human dexterity at Cal, and sue me I like school.

Outside of school, I'm a Biomedical Engineering Society officer, member of the Bioengineering Honor Society, avid D&D adventurer and amateur martial artist.

I'm currently actively recruiting for the summer! If you might be interested, please reach out!
